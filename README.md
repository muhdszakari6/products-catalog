## Assumptions made

- Users would love to see the images of the products listed
- Input from search will be debounced and pending requests will be cancelled when new ones come in
- A select component to select a category from list of categories will be a nice to have

## Improvements

- Add a button to clear filters
- Lazy load product images
- Implement better UX
- Add a proper loader and error handling to components and logic
- Maintain consistency with using latest angular best practices
